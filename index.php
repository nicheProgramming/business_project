            PRSoftworks - Software for the common man
        </div>
        <p>
            The purpose of PRSoftworks is to help individuals 
            and companies get the software they need. The 
            company was founded by four individuals, who are 
            to date their only employees. Short term, 
            PRSoftworks wants to help establishments in the 
            local area attain the software they need to do 
            their jobs, with a focus on web apps. Long term, 
            as the company grows, we want to help as many 
            people worldwide accomplice great things with the 
            software we create. Computer languages we use 
            include, but are not limited to, HTML, CSS, 
            Javascript, and PHP. We require 4 business grade 
            workstations with the appropriate software 
            accomodations to do our jobs efficiently. To cover 
            initial costs, profits in the first month must be 
            upwards of $4000. However, this can likely be 
            spread out over a year or so to make necessary 
            income / month much smaller. Our advertisement 
            will be largely word-of-mouth, and we will 
            frequently email potential clients with ideas to 
            help drive their businesses forward, while 
            including recommendations from previous customers.
