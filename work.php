            This is a simple paragraph that is meant to be nice 
            and easy to type which is why there will be mommas no 
            periods or any capital letters so i guess this means that 
            it cannot really be considered a paragraph but just a 
            series of run on sentences this should help you get faster
            at typing as im trying not to use too many difficult words
            in it although i think that i might start making it hard
            by including some more difficult letters I'm typing pretty
            quickly so forgive me for any mistakes i think that i will
            not just tell you a story about the time i went to the zoo
            and found a monkey and a fox playing together they
